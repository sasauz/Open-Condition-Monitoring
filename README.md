# Open-Condition-Monitoring

OCM (Open Condition Monitoring) is a required part of a systematic method of defining tasks. Where it is known that changes in certain parameters indicate a mode change, such as from operating normally to failing.

It is envisaged that OCM will enable secure storage by common means to provide infrastructure to provide facility  for investigation and institution of anonymous analysis of data. The wider statistical significance of access to larger data sets would engender more usefull and flexible reporting systems. 

There is a requirement for secure anonymous data transfer from sensors, presentation, organisation and analysis of the data.

Cryptographic currency blockchain technology could be an ideal open technology backbone to exploit to enable rapid development of an enhanced system. The encrypted nature of the data, pear to peer (p2p) transfer, blockchain ledger and p2pool would enable a distributed network.

This gives the opportunity for cooperative effort whilst retaining personal data anonymity, if so designed.

Various levels of co-operation or running your own instance of OCM would be possible. For smaller users, services could be provided, I.e. the use of ASICs to secure a network, with optionally a payment method. Small users would just attach to common network, their analysis server (or service) would decrypt readings from the blockchain as a wallet does for cryptographic currency. High risk data could be secured by multi-signature cryptography (before being anonymised).

The blockchain would probably require features as described in PBA (Private Blockchain Addresses).

Such a system where the number of users is more limited and other secure layer can be added above the blockchain more easily as a data register. Although use of cryptographic technology automatically adds security layers, for instance secure backups of the sensor readings via multi instances of the blockchain and cryptographically securing those backups so the can't be tampered with.
