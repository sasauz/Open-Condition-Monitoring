# Open-Condition-Monitoring

What is Open Condition Monitoring?
==================================

OCM (Open Condition Monitoring) is a required part of a systematic method of defining tasks. Where it is known that changes in certain parameters indicate a mode change, such as from operating normally to failing.  

Initially OCM is open sourcing the Maintenance Techniques and Analysis overview :

[Open Condition Monitoring, MTA](MaintenanceTechniquesAnalysis/MaintenanceTechniquesAnalysis.html "Maintenance Review Techniques Over View")


It is envisaged that OCM will enable secure storage by common means to provide infrastructure to provide facility  for investigation and institution of anonymous analysis of data. The wider statistical significance of access to larger data sets would engender more useful and flexible reporting systems.  

There is a requirement for secure anonymous data transfer from sensors, presentation, organisation and analysis of the data.  

Cryptographic currency "Blockchain technology" could be an ideal open technology backbone to exploit to enable rapid development of an enhanced system. The encrypted nature of the data, peer to peer (P2P) transfer, Blockchain ledger and p2pool would enable a distributed network.  

This gives the opportunity for cooperative effort whilst retaining personal data anonymity, if so designed.  

Various levels of co-operation or running your own instance of OCM would be possible. For smaller users, services could be provided, I.e. the use of ASICs to secure a network, with optionally a payment method. Small users would just attach to common network, their analysis server (or service) would decrypt readings from the Blockchain as a wallet does for cryptographic currency. High risk data could be secured by multi-signature cryptography (before being anonymised).  

The blockchain would probably require features as described in PBA (Private Blockchain Addresses).

Such a system where the number of users is more limited and other secure layer can be added above the Blockchain more easily as a data register. Although use of cryptographic technology automatically adds security layers, for instance secure backups of the sensor readings via multiple instances of the Blockchain and cryptographically securing those backups so the can't be tampered with.  

## Open Condition Monitoring & Open Forums.  

Whilst governmental systems claim to be representative there is usually no formal channel of expression of grass roots opinion in most system, representatives garner views or assume their view is representative after being voted in. Whereas in software development and most industries and companies internet forums have been important in building communities to discuss and develop policy and functionality, no such forum has developed in the real world.  

This maybe because a forum without information is just an echo chamber, i.e. other facilities are required to make the general population have the interest to contribute to the discussion.  

OCM is envisaged, and has been based on, work done to provide tools to monitor mechanical machinery. However, it can also include work on the more complex monitoring of human health, and less complex but more unpredictable, monitoring of commercial enterprises.
In particular close monitoring of government related tasks and budgets, with suitable analysis to show a wide range of considerations.  

The synergy of A.I. techniques to normalise and fuse data from available sources, say by agents. Such a system might highlight that a trend is due to a particular external cause, no one had thought of, which changed the attitude to worrying trends.

The core principle of sharing meta data are particularly relevant to health data and stands of such analysis. A grass roots discussion of how that should be done would aide its inception and agile development of health monitoring standards beyond the individual.  

By developing the tools behind open forums as open source, it would encourage rapid development over many areas where there is currently a vacuum.  


## Monitoring the human survival system


Human survival depends on a suitable environment. The population needs to be as cleaver and informed in order to act against any real dangers. In the past ideas could be tested in the environment, in that was so large it could recover, or at least stabilise, even if at the disadvantage of other species.

The current idea is that open condition monitoring could facilitate the invention and distribution of citizen monitoring sensors, develop distributed storage via block chain and help produce compile reports on Github. It could also look to see how data could be imported from other sources. 

Monitoring parameters is fine but it is also important that these are attached to decisions, maintenance or policies so they can be calibrated to indicate what is happening in the real world. 

### Initial Tasks : 

#### Identify Modes of success

e.g.  Amount of parks available to each personal

#### Identify Modes of failure

e.g. Amount of parks area per mile per person should be above X (50%?)


#### Identify monitorable parameters

There are ways to proceed, generate the required known problems. This will entail citizen data collection, this can be just hosting a sensor. Additionally, use available data and attach this to monitor causes of failure, proportionally to it's applicability. 

e.g. Possible  parameters   Proportion of fat in food sold, Proportion of sugar in food sold, Noise levels, Pollutants, sunlight obscured, Pot holes, Government maintenance back logs, visits to government websites, polls on the subject

#### Identifying new trends or issues

It can be seen there is a possibility to have parameters designed to raise, or prioritise new issues, as well as monitor old ones for deterioration.

#### Data storage structure and relevance

Potential data structure 

Open Condition Monitoring  
 Global Concerns (Global, Environmental, Governmental, Resources)  
  Regional Concerns (Environment, Supply, Energy, Assets, Skills, Regional Infrastructure)  
   Local Concerns  (Employment, Energy, Environment, Skills, Local Infrastructure)  
    Assets (Buildings, Structure, Equipment, Devices, Personnel)  
     Methods (RCM, FTA, FMEA, FMECA, FSA, Information)  
      Parameters (CM, NDT, History, Events, Data)  
       Syndromes (Trends, Ways ahead, Theories, Conclusions)  
       
#### Alternatives to sensors methods of data collection

Some monitoring parameter would be possible using the "population". For instance relying on institutional statistics such as crime rates for the police is automatically biased. Relying on the opinion of the public is also easily biased by the media.

It would be possible have a "app" people could use and report all of the incidence type they've experienced. It is strictly not efficient use of time and possible privacy hazard to a lot of people.

However, it is possible to envisage a probabilistic method where a large number of volunteers are sampled (to a tested error rate)  on  a regular basis, on wither the feel they've experienced a crime? Or had a car accident in last week or such, thus acquiring use-full data to compare with institutional statistics.

This means some data can be collected in advance of of open hard ware or sensor systems being developed and distributed.

It would be advantageous for political parties to sponsor information collation to gain addition information of the success of policies. For instance, the amounts of certain types of specific complaints or observations sent to MPs could be specifically counted. Note that the total number of correspondence to MPs may also indicate problems.

#### Methods of automating sensor data collection using Machine Learning

An example of how machine learning can be used to set up a large array of citizen sensors might be the effect of aircraft condensation trails or cloud cover. A complex issue to distinguish normally.

Volunteers would have a cheap USB camera set to view any open & fixed section of the sky. An robot system such as http://openbiometrics.org/docs/install/  Poppy, could be used to view the camera and log features such a brightness.

This can be done by pre-training "face recognition" and "robot control" and loging the results as a trend. 

The robot is trained with 2 cameras initially. The robot has control of the brightness of one camera and is trained to duplicate the automatic brightness control in the other. That trained "brain" can then be applied on the sensor site where it be allowed to improve it's fine control of that environment. The logged adjustments to brightness can be trended and give a measure of the cloud cover.

It would be then possible to use other machine learning techniques to automatically monitor particular issues. For instance cloud cover, or sky brightness could be data fused with an aircraft events in the area. ie give a report or trend that would show if there is any correlation, the amount and the error.

The ability of the system to be trained to distinguish between plane trails and clouds gives another advantage. It could give a guesstimate of brightness change due to aeroplanes. In that case by assisted learning with a large number of tests measured for proportion. It seems probable that a climate system will soon be developed which recognises types of cloud, which could be extended with extra training to record the proportion of plane con trails.

The system could then be retrained and used, say, to detect traffic levels or other issues, and use face recognition to detect type and direction, use the robot ability to store trendable data.
